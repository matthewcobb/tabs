"Ignition (Remix)"

Now, um, usually I don't do this but uh....
Go head' on and break em off wit a lil' preview of the remix....

No I'm not trying to be rude,
But hey pretty girl I'm feeling you
The way you do the things you do
Reminds me of my Lexus coupe
That's why I'm all up in yo grill
Tryina get you to a hotel
You must be a football coach
The way you got me playing the field

So baby gimme that toot toot
Lemme give you that beep beep
Running her hands through my 'fro
Bouncing on 24's
While they say on the radio...

It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rolling that body
got every man in here wishing
Sipping on coke and rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freaking weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun

Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce
Bounce Bounce Bounce

Now it's like murder she wrote
Once I get you out them clothes
Privacy is on the door
Still they can hear you screaming more
Girl I'm feeling what you feeling
No more hoping and wishing
I'm bout to take my key and
Stick it in the ignition

So baby gimme that toot toot
Lemme give you that beep beep
Running her hands through my 'fro
Bouncing on 24's
While they say on the radio...

It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rolling that body
Got every man in here wishing
Sipping on coke and rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freaking weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun

Cristal popping in the stretch Navigator
We got food everywhere
As if the party was catered
We got fellas to my left
Hunnies on my right
We bring em both together we got junking all night
Then after the show it's the (after party)
And after the party its the (hotel lobby)
And round about 4 you gotta (clear the lobby)
Then head take it to the room and freak somebody

Can I get a toot toot
Can I get a beep beep
Running her hands through my 'fro
Bouncing on 24's
While they say on the radio...

It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rolling that body
Got every man in here wishing
Sipping on coke and rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freaking weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun

It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rolling that body
Got every man in here wishing
Sipping on coke and rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freaking weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun

Girl we off in this jeep
Fogging windows up
Blasting the radio
In the back of my truck
Bouncing up and down
Stroke it round and round
To the remix
We just thuggin it out...
